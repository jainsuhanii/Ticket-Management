# Fullstack Task Manager (MERN) :star2:



# Overview
A web application called Task Manager was created to make team task management more efficient. Constructed with the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—this platform offers an easy-to-use interface for productive task delegation, monitoring, and cooperation. With a wealth of features to improve efficiency and organization, the application serves both regular users and administrators.

Efficient task management is essential for team success in a dynamic work environment. Task tracking using manual systems or spreadsheets can be laborious and error-prone in traditional approaches.
